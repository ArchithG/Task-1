# Task-1

So after Task#0 wer got task #1 in which we were instructed to do minimum of three circuits with the given sensors. The first thing which I had in mind was a simple night lamp with a switch to manually off it. To make this I had to go through about the given sensors with the help of articles in TinkerCAD and ChatGPT and then I worked upon my projects. The first one is an environmental study circuit which employs temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor and photoresistor. I had in mind to make circuit which would be helpful for the rover as this above mentioned circuit can be used to study about the soil nature along with the surrounding factors such as light intensity and temperature. Then I made a tilt and force sensor based stability circuit which would give off a buzzer or LED or both depending on the sensor. This is the one which I had put a lot of effort in as to get the values correct. Then finally a simple automatic night lamp with a switch to manually turn it off.
